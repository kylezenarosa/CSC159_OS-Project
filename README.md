# CSC159_OS-Project

CSC159: Operating System Pragmatics

This operating system project was a group term project consisting of different phases
throughout the semester. The goal was to implement and simulate a simple OS model in order 
to gain a better understanding of system internals. Three phases were implemented. Phase 1
was the initialization phase, where data structures for both user processes and kernel tasks
were initialized. The second phase consisted of implementing system call and interrupt APIs 
to simulate communication between user and kernel context. The third phase consisted of 
simulating sychronization and interprocess communication concepts. Semaphores and IPC 
data structures were implemented.
